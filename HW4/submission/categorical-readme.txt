I had built a custom model called SusNetv2 which took hybrid approaches (suspicious/skeptical if one architecture is good and hence the name) from Squeezenet, Peleenet. But the training time was close to 45 mins an epoch and the instance kept crashing so I had to stop at 58% on it and move to training Mobilenetv2 from scratch (categorical-model.pth, categorical-model.png) both of which I have attached. 

SusNetv2.png is an extra attachment to show the attempts at building custom models.
